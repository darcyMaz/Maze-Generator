To be added to readme:
- explain how it works
- explain how to use the examples

To do for this repo:
- Yes I know I can use GitHub projects but it's so tucked away I'm not using that
- Combine code and examples into one package
- Add more algorithms and functionality to easily and efficiently switch between them
- Make demo build using maze assignment
